The SDLC comprises of various stages, each with defined tasks and goals focused on providing a high quality software product.
The phases are:
1: Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2: Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3: Coding/Implementation - Writing code and building the software based on the design specifications.
4: Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5: Deployment - The release of the software to the users.
6: Maintainance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Waterfall Model is the sequential approach whereby each phase of developement must be completed before the next begins.
The Waterfall model works best in situations where project requirements are clearly defined and not expected to change, technology is stable, and there is a high demand for thorough documentation and regulatory adherence. Its organized, sequential method guarantees a smooth advancement through each stage of the project, facilitating management and control in scenarios that require predictability and thorough documentation.
The Agile model is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and repsonding to change.
The Agile model approach is most effective in situations where change is anticipated and the capacity to provide value in small increments is crucial. Agile models can greatly improve the development process by emphasizing flexibility, ongoing enhancement, and active stakeholder participation to ensure the final product meets user needs and market conditions effectively.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is a methodical procedure used to outline, record, and uphold the requirements for a software system. This is a crucial stage in the software development process which guarantees that the end product satisfies the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
1: Elicitation - Gathering requirements from stakeholders
2: Analysis - Analyze and refine gathered requirments to ensure they are clear, feasible and complete.
3: Specification - Document requirements in a clear and detailed manner
4: Validation - Ensure that documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible.
5: Management - Manage changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design involves dividing a complex software system into smaller, autonomous, and interconnected modules or components. Every module carries out a particular range of tasks and comes with clearly defined connections for communicating with other modules. This idea is essential in software engineering as it enhances maintenance, scalability, reusability, and overall system flexibility. Modularity enhances the ability to maintain and scale software systems by enabling changes to be isolated and functionality to be encapsulated within separate modules. This allows developers to make changes or updates to individual modules without affecting the whole system, minimizing the possibility of errors and making debugging and maintenance easier. The ability to easily add new capabilities or features is made possible by modularity, which also contributes to the scalability of the system. Every module has the ability to be adjusted separately according to need, leading to efficient use of resources and guaranteeing system stability and performance across different workloads.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Intergration Testing: Testing interaction between different componants or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it needs user needs.
Testing is critical aspect of quality assurance as quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing and continuous intergration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to a higher quality product.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that track changes to files and code over time, enabling developers to collaborate on projects, manage revisions, track changes, and maintain a history of modifications made to the codebase. They are crucial in software development as they provide a structured approach to managing code, improve collaboration among team members, and ensure the integrity and reliability of the codebase. Examples of popular version control systems and their features include:
Git: Distributed Version Control, Branching and Merging, Lightweight and Fast, Version History, Collaboration Tools
Subversion (SVN): Centralized Version Control, Atomic Commits, Branching and Tagging,  Access Control,  Merge Tracking
Mercurial (Hg): Distributed Version Control, Simplicity and Ease of Use, Performance, Extensions and Plugins, Cross-Platform Compatibility

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Running software projects requires handling numerous duties like planning, overseeing teams, collecting requirements, evaluating risks, budgeting, ensuring quality, communicating with stakeholders, and managing changes. Major obstacles include managing scope changes and evolving needs, limited resources, complex technology, tight deadlines, team dynamics and morale, stakeholder expectations, risk control, software quality assurance, and effective communication and collaboration among various project participants. Successfully managing these duties and obstacles necessitates blending strategic planning, good leadership, solid communication skills, skilled problem-solving capabilities, and flexibility to adjust to evolving project dynamics.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance refers to the process of modifying, updating, and enhancing software applications after they have been deployed to ensure they continue to meet user needs, remain compatible with evolving technologies, and address any issues or defects that may arise. It involves various activities aimed at improving the performance, reliability, security, and usability of the software throughout its lifecycle.
The different types of maintenance activities include:
Corrective Maintenance: Focuses on fixing defects, bugs, and errors identified during software usage.
Involves analyzing reported issues, diagnosing root causes, and implementing corrective measures to resolve problems.
Aimed at restoring software functionality and reliability.
Adaptive Maintenance: Involves modifying software to adapt to changes in external environments, technologies, or hardware configurations. Ensures software remains compatible and functional in evolving environments.
Perfective Maintenance: Focuses on enhancing software functionality, performance, and usability based on user feedback and evolving requirements. This includes adding new features, improving user interfaces, optimizing code for better performance, and enhancing system scalability.
Preventive Maintenance: Involves proactively identifying and addressing potential issues, vulnerabilities, and inefficiencies in software systems.
Emergency Maintenance: Addresses critical and urgent issues that require immediate attention to avoid system failures, downtime, or data loss.
Maintenance is essential for the durability, efficiency, safety, and usability of software systems, and it is a necessary stage in the software lifecycle that contributes to continuous business growth and advancement.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
